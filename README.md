# This project involves two stages:
## **Stage 1: Data Manipulation**
The first stage of the project involves manipulating the data to make it more informative and useful. This may involve adding tags or metadata to the data to help categorize it and make it easier to search and filter.
For example, if the data is a collection of articles, tags might be added to indicate the topic of each article, the author, the date it was published, and so on. This makes it much easier to search for articles on a specific topic or by a particular author.

## **Stage 2: Integration with OpenSearch**
The second stage of the project involves integrating the manipulated data into OpenSearch, which is an open-source search and analytics engine. This will make the data searchable and accessible to users.
To integrate the data with OpenSearch, it will need to be indexed, which involves creating a mapping of the data to the fields that OpenSearch uses for search and filtering. Once the data is indexed, users will be able to search for it using keywords, filters, and other criteria.

_Overall, the goal of this project is to make it easier for users to find and access the data they need by manipulating it and integrating it into a search engine. This can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data-driven decision-making processes._
